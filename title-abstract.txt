Title:
Clearer Views for Cancer Research: Upgrading Chromosome Analysis

Abstract:
Cancer research is pivotal for understanding and combating the disease, with cell research playing a crucial role due to the genetic mutations leading to tu- mors. However, manual analysis of cell images is time-consuming and error- prone. Our project proposes to develop an advanced system for understand- ing variations in chromosome numbers and structures. Our project targets the development of an imaging system to accurately segment individual chro- mosomes within cell images, which addresses the key issue of past systems that weren’t able to do so. It’s especially important because cells with abnor- mal chromosome counts contribute to cancer growth by changing the number of oncogenes. To create our imaging system, we decided to transition from semantic segmentation to instance segmentation in order to delineate indi- vidual chromosomes. This approach contrasts with existing methods, such as ecSeg, which, while useful for identifying chromosome clusters, falls short in accurately quantifying individual chromosomes. Our project aims to bridge this gap by leveraging advanced computational methods to develop optimal bounding boxes for each chromosome, facilitating precise identification of the chromosome centers. The anticipated outcome is a robust tool capable of providing detailed chromosomal profiles in cancer cells during metaphase, thereby contributing to a deeper understanding of cancer genetics and poten- tially unveiling new avenues for diagnosis and treatment.
